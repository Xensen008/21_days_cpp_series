## Overview

In C++, classes and objects are fundamental concepts that support the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). They provide a way to structure and organize code by encapsulating data and behavior into a single unit. This README file will guide you through the basics of classes and objects in C++, covering their definition, syntax, and usage.

## What are Classes and Objects?

In C++, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class, and it represents a real-world entity that has attributes (data members) and behaviors (member functions).

## Defining a Class

```cpp
// Syntax for class definition
class ClassName {
public:
    // Data members
    DataType member1;
    DataType member2;

    // Member functions
    ReturnType function1(parameters);
    ReturnType function2(parameters);
    // ...
};
```

- `class`: Keyword to declare a class.
- `ClassName`: Name of the class.
- `public`: Access specifier defining the visibility of class members (public, private, protected).
- `DataType`: Type of the data members.
- `ReturnType`: Type of the function's return value.
- `function1`, `function2`: Member functions.

## Creating Objects

```cpp
// Creating an object
ClassName objectName;
```

## Class Members

### Data Members

Data members are variables that hold information about the object.

### Member Functions

Member functions are functions that operate on the object's data and perform specific tasks.

## Access Specifiers

- `public`: Members are accessible from outside the class.
- `private`: Members are only accessible within the class.
- `protected`: Similar to private but with limited accessibility in derived classes.

## Constructor and Destructor

- Constructor: Special member function used for initializing the object's data. It has the same name as the class.
- Destructor: Special member function used for cleanup when the object goes out of scope.

## Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Dog {
private:
    std::string name;
    int age;

public:
    // Constructor
    Dog(std::string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}

    // Member function
    void bark() {
        std::cout << name << " says Woof!" << std::endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Dog() {
        std::cout << name << " is destroyed." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating objects
    Dog myDog("Buddy", 3);

    // Accessing members
    myDog.bark();

    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

Understanding classes and objects is crucial for building modular and maintainable C++ programs.
