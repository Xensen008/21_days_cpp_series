# 21-Day C Programming Language Learning Challenge

Welcome to my 21-day learning challenge repository, where I embark on a journey to explore the fundamentals and advanced concepts of the C programming language. This challenge is designed to enhance my understanding of C and strengthen my programming skills over a three-week period.

## Introduction

My solo 21-day challenge to deepen my understanding of C++. üöÄüí° This journey will be a celebration of learning, coding, and continuous improvement
Every day, I'll immerse myself in different C++ topics, offering explanations, code snippets, and practical examples. This will serve as both a personal coding journal and an open resource for anyone looking to explore or learn alongside me.

## GitHub Repository Updates

All code snippets and related materials will be documented in this GitHub repository. Feel free to explore, comment, or contribute. Let's make this repository a collaborative space for learning and sharing knowledge..


## Structure of the Repository
**/21-day-cpp-challenge:** The root directory contains subdirectories for each day of the challenge, where you can find code implementations and detailed notes.

**day-01/, day-02/, ...:** Each day's directory further contains:

- **code/:** Subdirectory housing the code snippets and programs written on that specific day.
- **notes.md:** Markdown file providing insights, explanations, and any additional notes related to the day's topics.
  
**resources/:** This directory includes any supplementary materials, links, or documents that support the learning journey.

**README.md:** The main documentation file you are currently reading, which serves as a guide to the repository's content and the 21-day C++ learning challenge.
