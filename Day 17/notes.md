# Iterators 

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive guide to iterators in C++. Iterators are an essential feature in C++ that allow you to traverse through containers like arrays, vectors, lists, and more. Understanding iterators is crucial for effective manipulation and traversal of container elements.

## What are Iterators?

An iterator in C++ is an object that enables the iteration (traversal) of elements in a container, providing a way to access the elements sequentially. It acts as a bridge between the algorithm and container, allowing you to perform various operations on the container's elements.

## Types of Iterators

C++ provides several types of iterators, each with its own characteristics:

- **Input Iterators:** Supports reading values from a range in a forward-only manner.
- **Output Iterators:** Supports writing values to a range in a forward-only manner.
- **Forward Iterators:** Combines features of both input and output iterators, supporting forward traversal and modification.
- **Bidirectional Iterators:** Allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.
- **Random Access Iterators:** Provides full random access capabilities, like arrays.

## Iterator Functions and Operations

Common iterator functions include:

- `begin()`: Returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the container.
- `end()`: Returns an iterator pointing to the past-the-end element of the container.
- `advance()`: Moves the iterator forward or backward by a specified number of positions.
- `distance()`: Calculates the distance between two iterators.
- `next()`, `prev()`: Moves the iterator to the next or previous position.
